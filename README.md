## Overview

### Scenario

You have been hired as a data engineer by a research organization. You've been tasked by your team to create an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract daily weather forecast and observed weather data and load it into a live report to be used for further analysis by the analytics team. As part of a larger prediction modelling project, the team wants to use the report to monitor and measure the historical accuracy of temperature forecasts by source and station.

The job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every city to prepare the report. 

As a proof-of-concept (POC), you are only required to do this for a single station and one source to begin with. For each day at noon (local time), you will gather both the actual temperature and the temperature forecasted for noon on the following day for Berlin, Germany.

At a later stage, the team anticipates extending the report to include lists of locations, different forecasting sources, different update frequencies, and other weather metrics such as wind speed and direction, precipitation, and visibility.
